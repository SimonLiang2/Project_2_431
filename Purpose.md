Main Reason for Using Erlang:

Erlang was originally developed by Ericsson in the 1980s to serve as a solution to the problems in building telecommunication systems. 
These systems require high uptime, scalability and the ability to handle failures in a graceful manner, which Erlang does well at. 
Its characteristics of handling concurrency and fault tolerance well allows for it to be suitable for scalable systems/applications that require high availability and real time performance. 
Things like telecommunications, messaging systems, financial services, web servers and APIs, real-time systems and distributed databases are able to make great use of Erlang.
Though it may not be as mainstream as languages such as Python and Java, it still provides unique capabilities that are still needed in today's time.
