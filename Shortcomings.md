Erlang is still in use today, although there are cases/factors that have contributed to its reduced adoption.
One of the reasons is that Erlang was created to solve specific problems with telecommunications. While these features are highly valuable and are pros, they also come with cons. It is because these features aren't necessarily in demand across all kinds of software development, causing its adoption to be limited to companies/industries focused on telecommunications, message systems and distributed applications of Erlang. Erlang is limited by this, causing it to be less popular than the other languages that are used for general purpose.
