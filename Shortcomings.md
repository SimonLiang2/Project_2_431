Erlang is still in use today, although there are cases/factors that have contributed to its reduced adoption.
One of the main reasons is that Erlang was created to solve specific problems with telecommunications. While these features are highly valuable and are pros, they also come with cons. 
It is because these features aren't necessarily in demand across all kinds of software development, causing its adoption to be limited to companies/industries focused on telecommunications, message systems and distributed applications of Erlang. Erlang is limited by this, causing it to be less popular than the other languages that are used for general purpose.
Another reason why is due to its performance. Compared to the more popular languages like C++ and Java, Erlang is slower in terms of CPU performance. This is due to its focus on lightweight processes, concurrency and message passing. 
Additionally, Erlang cant handle high performance tasks well because of these lightweight processes. Erlang can have thousands of threads, but these threads would have to share a limited processing speed. 
Erlang also struggles with its somewhat steep learning curve, from its syntax to its documentation. It is a functional programming language, where the syntax is hard for programmers that are more used to other languages like OOP (Object Oriented Programming).
